Public health experts ask people to stay inside to social distance ourselves as a means to **lesson the impact of the pandemic on those most vulnerable**.

You've heard of [#FlattenTheCurve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/). You've seen [#CattenTheCurve](https://twitter.com/amdar1ing/status/1237880129575157760). Let's them put them together in the most effective way possible.

## On Saturday March 21 let's all stay home and watch Cats!

Don't go out. Invite your friends to stream Cats to their TVs and fire up a group text message, Google Hangout, or Facebook group and watch this brilliant* movie together from the comfort of everyone's own home.

Cats (2019) is availible for [digital purchse](https://www.playbill.com/article/cats-movie-sets-digital-blu-ray-and-dvd-release-dates) but maybe [Universal Pictures](https://twitter.com/UniversalPics) will let us have it for discount/free to help us all #CattenTheCurve?

**We can all help to lessen the spread of Coronavirus by joining the movement to #CattenTheCurve**

*Note: I have not seen the movie Cats yet, and have no affiliation with the producers of the film.
