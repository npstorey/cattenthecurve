Public health experts ask people to stay inside to social distance ourselves as a means to **lessen the impact of the pandemic on those most vulnerable**.

You've heard of [#FlattenTheCurve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/). You've seen [#CattenTheCurve](https://twitter.com/amdar1ing/status/1237880129575157760). Let's them put them together in the most effective way possible.

## Stay home and watch Cats!

Don't go out. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not until this pandemic is clearly under control. Watch a movie (like Cats) instead.

Let's all [invite our friends](https://www.facebook.com/events/209163706819909/) to stream Cats to their TVs and fire up a group text message, Google Hangout, or Facebook group and watch this brilliant* movie together from the comfort of everyone's own home.

Don't want to pay to own the digitl rights to watch CATS?

[Vulture is hosting an Instagram watch party](https://www.vulture.com/2020/03/watch-cats-with-us-on-instagram-live-tonight.html)

[Seth Rogen live tweeted watching CATS last night](https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1240122704226811906). Maybe he will do it again?

Regular Cats not weird enough for you? Apparently there is a version where all the the cats have digial buttholes.

Cats (2019) is available for [digital purchase](https://www.playbill.com/article/cats-movie-sets-digital-blu-ray-and-dvd-release-dates) but maybe [Universal Pictures](https://twitter.com/UniversalPics) will let us have it for discount/free to help us all #CattenTheCurve?

**We can all help to lessen the spread of Coronavirus by joining the movement to #CattenTheCurve**

*Note: I have not seen the movie Cats yet, and have no affiliation with the producers of the film.
